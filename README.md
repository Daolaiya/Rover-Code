Project: Arduino-controlled Rover Code

This is the MATLAB code for the autonomous navigation of an arduino-controlled rover.
The code is designed to simulate ultrasonic sensors, motors and the exactly physical dimensions of the constructed rover and maze.

The rover can localize itself and navigate with obstacle detection and avoidance within a walled maze using ultrasonic sensors.
The rover can also find a small object within the maze, pick the object, navigate to a given drop-off zone and unload the object.
This rover code comes with a simulator for testing the effectiveness of the code within a virtual environment.

To simulate the operation, the Main.m and Rover_Main.m codes should be run, in that order, in separate MATLAB windows.
